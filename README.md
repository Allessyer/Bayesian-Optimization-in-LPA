# Bayesian-Optimization-in-LPA
Application of Bayesian optimization to improve beam quality of laser plasma accelerators.

## Introduction to a problem

At the moment, traditional accelerators have their limits, and we need to find alternatives for them. Laser plasma accelerators (LPA) are very inter-
esting as a replacement for conventional accelerators, because of their small size and large accelerating fields. However producing high-quality beams
concerning industrial needs requires a meticulous balancing of a variety of physical effects and, as a result, is both conceptually and experimentally
hard. This work investigates how to optimize the source of electrons in the LPA for given requests from industry and academic institutions. Particularly,
the use of Bayesian Optimization on LPA parameters to achieve 150 MeV acceleration with a maximum energy conversion efficiency from the laser to the electron beam is studied.
